Description: Provides a probabilistic framework that integrates Data
  Envelopment Analysis (DEA) with machine-learning classifiers to estimate
  the (in)efficiency status and the probability of efficiency for
  decision-making units. Models are trained on DEA-derived labels and
  evaluated via 'caret', enabling explainable workflows with global
  diagnostics (e.g., permutation importance, Shapley-value summaries via
  'fastshap', and sensitivity analysis) and effect plots (partial and
  accumulated dependence), probability-threshold peer selection, and
  counterfactual improvement suggestions for benchmarking and policy
  analysis.
